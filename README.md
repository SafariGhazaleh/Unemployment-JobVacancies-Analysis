# Unemployment-JobVacancies-Analysis

## Data Analysis - Unemployment Rate and Unfilled Job Vacancies

### Problem Statement
This repository contains the Python script for analyzing the statistical relationship between the unemployment rate and the number of unfilled job vacancies in Germany. 
The assignment involves downloading and merging the data series, performing regression analysis, and visualizing the results.
The data sets can be downloaded as CSV files from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

### Solution
1. **Python Script:**
   - The script (`Assignment2GhazalehSafari.py`) reads and merges the two data sets.
   - It computes growth rates and plots various observations, including regression plots and diagnostic plots.

2. **Results and Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis, the script concludes that there is a negative significant correlation between the unemployment rate and unfilled job vacancies.
   - Key statistical indicators such as intercept, coefficient, t-statistic, p-values, and diagnostic plots support this conclusion.
